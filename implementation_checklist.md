# Implementation Checklist

Use this checklist to validate the upgraded Emotion-Driven Storyteller before sharing it or deploying.

## âœ… Environment Setup
- [ ] Create and activate a virtual environment.
- [ ] Install dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- [ ] Verify `streamlit`, `opencv-python`, `deepface`, `pyttsx3`, and `transformers` import without errors.

## ðŸŽ¥ Emotion Detection
- [ ] Confirm the webcam opens and displays the OpenCV preview window.
- [ ] Test successful detection above your chosen confidence threshold.
- [ ] Trigger a low-confidence scenario to verify the warning and last-detection message.
- [ ] Validate manual emotion selection produces a story without scanning.

## ðŸ“– Story Generation
- [ ] Generate a template-based story for each base emotion.
- [ ] Enable AI generation and confirm the Hugging Face model produces extended narratives.
- [ ] Adjust temperature/top_p settings and observe narrative variation.

## ðŸ”Š Narration
- [ ] Confirm narration plays when enabled.
- [ ] Adjust speech rate and volume controls and listen for changes.
- [ ] Disable narration and ensure replay prompts the user accordingly.

## ðŸª„ UX & State Management
- [ ] Review emotion badges for accurate color coding and confidence formatting.
- [ ] Generate multiple stories and confirm they appear in the history panel with timestamps.
- [ ] Validate that the sidebar controls persist after reruns (session state intact).

## ðŸ“¦ Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] Read through `README.md` for clarity and completeness.
- [ ] Optionally containerize or prepare Streamlit Cloud configuration.
- [ ] Capture screenshots or a short demo video for portfolio sharing.

# Project Modifications Guide

This document captures the architectural changes applied to transform the Emotion-Driven Storyteller into a production-ready application.

## 1. Data Layer Enhancements
- Replaced the minimalist story catalogue with multi-paragraph narratives for each core emotion.
- Added a dedicated entry for `fear` to align with popular emotion taxonomies.
- Ensured all templates can serve as prompts for optional AI continuation.

## 2. Emotion Detection Upgrades
- Introduced confidence scoring surfaced in both UI badges and overlay text.
- Added timeout and threshold parameters to balance responsiveness and accuracy.
- Provided a manual emotion fallback path for hardware-limited or privacy-conscious users.
- Stored the last detection metadata to inform the user when scans fail.

## 3. Story Generation Pipeline
- Wrapped Hugging Face `text-generation` pipeline as an optional layer with graceful degradation when dependencies are absent.
- Cached model loading to avoid repeated downloads or warm-up costs.
- Exposed configurable hyperparameters (tokens, temperature, top_p) through the UI.
- Preserved high-quality templates as fallbacks to guarantee deterministic output.

## 4. User Experience Refresh
- Redesigned `app.py` with a wide layout, sidebar controls, and responsive columns.
- Added emotion badges, story history, AI usage labeling, and narration toggles.
- Implemented structured session state to track current story, history, and settings.
- Provided explicit feedback for scan cancellations, low-confidence results, and narration availability.

## 5. Deployment Readiness
- Populated `requirements.txt` with pinned versions tested on Windows.
- Documented setup, troubleshooting, and feature highlights in the new `README.md`.
- Centralized resource instantiation via `@st.cache_resource` to avoid redundant loading.

## 6. Suggested Next Steps
- Containerize with Docker for reproducible deployments.
- Add automated tests for template selection and detector thresholds.
- Integrate analytics (e.g., Streamlit telemetry or custom logging) for usage insights.
